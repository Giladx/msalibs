These are two sample xibs (InterfaceBuilder files) for ofxCocoa.

use NoWindow.xib if you want to create your window programmatically (e.g. fullscreen, transparent background, no decoration etc.)

use WithWindow.xib if you want to design your interface in InterfaceBuilder. Do Not modify this file, instead create a copy of it, edit that, and add that to your project. 

In the "Info-Cocoa.plist" file, edit "Main nib file base name" and enter the name of the xib you would like to use.
